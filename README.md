# Helping Hand

A medication database and prescription management system, developed as a part of a university project.

Developed by a team of six members, the team was named 'Team Hexa'. The members were:

* Shamah Mahbub Zoha
* Ashis Kumar Das
* Zarin Irtiza
* Irin Nahar
* Abdullah Al Samir
* Shameer Azmi

The following are the dependecies (libraries) that are required to compile and run the application:

* **SQLite JDBC Driver** by *xerial*, which was used to establish the connection between the application and the underlying SQLite database it uses. The project and related documentations can be found [here](https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc).

* **JTattoo**, which was used to add the unique look-and-feel to the application, swaying away from the usual graphical interface offered by the Java Swing library. The library and related documentations can be found [here](http://www.jtattoo.net/).

**SQLite JDBC Driver** is licensed under Apache License, version 2.0, which can be found [here](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

**JTattoo** is licensed under GNU General Public License version 2.0, which can be found [here](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt).

The application itself, however, is licensed under GNU General Public License, version 3.0. A copy of the license can be found in the repository itself and [here](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html).

The application was coded entirely in Eclipse, in 2015.
